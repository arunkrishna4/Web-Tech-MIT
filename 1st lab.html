		The BMW is an instantly recognizable symbol, a tribute to the company’s early days as an aircraft manufacturer. Originally, BMW attempted to appeal to baby boomers, producing sports sedans that were luxurious and demonstrated high performance.
		This became the 3, 5, and 7 series which were a similar design in different sizes. At the beginning of the 21
		<sup>st</sup> 
		century, as consumer needs shifted, BMW began to introduce a wide variety of other vehicles, ranging from premium SUVs to convertibles and roadsters, as well as cheaper compact cars in Series 1. BMW offered options to family-oriented consumers, wealthy conservatives that sought luxury, and those needing bigger cars for outdoor activities, as well as those seeking highly flamboyant vehicles.
